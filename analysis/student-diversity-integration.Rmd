In 2020, there will be more children of color than white children. This analysis uses student data to explore how the changing demographics of the county are impacting our schools. 


First, we read in and clean up the 2016-2017 school year data. School and student data is from the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES). It can be downloaded here: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp. We also used a rural/urban classification from NCES that can be downloaded here: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries. To best identify school districts to include in our analysis, we used a list provided by [EdBuild](https://edbuild.org/).

Then we read in the 1994-1995 data, which, of course, has a totally different format. It can be downloaded here: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp. No locale classification or EdBuild data here. We filtered out schools and districts based on name. Charters and virtuals were also way less common back then. We backfilled locale classifications. Some places have likely suburbanized over time, but we only refer to the classifications in present day.
